# Boggle!
By Serah Park

## Description
I recreated Boggle, a game in which players select adjacent letters on a 4x4 grid of letters to form words, that can be played as a text-based command line game as well as a graphical game. Boggle was written in Python using a graphics package based on the pygame module and a lexicon provided as a part of the Williams CSCI 134 Lab 09 assignment.

## Dependencies
`pip install pygame
`
## How to play:
* Text boggle - type `python3 textboggle.py` in the command line to play; after completing a word, select the most recently selected letter (last letter of the word) again to submit the word.
* Graphical boggle - type `python3 boggle.py` in the command line to play; click on letters to form words and click on the last letter twice to submit the word.
